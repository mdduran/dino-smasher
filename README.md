# Dino smasher c++ implementation

This game is a reproduction of one of the example games from the Arduboy Community tutorial by [crait](http://www.twitter.com/crait).
- Original tutorial link: https://community.arduboy.com/t/make-your-own-arduboy-game-part-8-starting-dinosmasher/7932

## Technical goals
Rewrite this game using C++ and [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/lib/show/192/Arduboy)

**P.S.** There is no smashing, or dinos.... i was fooled by the title of the original tutorial, but we do have a nice game baseline ðŸŽ®
